                            This will ensure that allotments and refunds are effected to the

                            For payments via M-Pesa using a reference number from the DSE platform,
                            every reference is tied to a single specific amount, so you may only pay
                            for the shares that you have applied for at that time. Normal M-PESA
                            transaction limits will apply on all transactions.

                        <p>
                            Yes. However, if payment is being made via M-Pesa, then the entire payment
                            sum must be paid in one payment, it cannot be staggered. For example, if
                            you are to pay Tzs 850,000 for the purchase of 100 shares, then you must
                            pay Tzs 850,000 in one payment. You will not be able to break this payment
                            down in to smaller multiple sums.
